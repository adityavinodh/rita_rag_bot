    "text": "Helpful? Yes NoTable of Contents \nExpert advice from Apple Support\nApple Support advisors help iPhone customers with all sorts of questions from forgotten passwords to lost\nphotos. Below are a few pieces of advice that Apple Support advisors wish all iPhone owners knew. Follow\nthese simple steps now to keep your iPhone, and the important information you keep on it, safe.\nJust in case you forget\nAfter you set up your iPhone, there are two things you really\ndonʼt want to forget—your iPhone passcode and your Apple\nAccount information. Your iPhone passcode is the four- or six-\ndigit numerical code that you use to unlock your iPhone. You\nuse your Apple Account to sign in to Apple services, make\npurchases in the App Store, and more. Your Apple Account is\ntypically your primary email address or phone number and the\nunique password you create to use with it.\nIf you think you might forget these things, you can designate a\ntrusted person as your account recovery contact. Your recovery\ncontact doesnʼt have access to your iPhone or Apple account,\nbut they can give you a code to reset your passcode or access\nyour account if you get locked out. To set up a recovery\ncontact, go to Settings  > [your name] > Sign-In & Security >\nAccount Recovery, tap Add Recovery Contact, then follow the\nonscreen instructions.\nHow to find your iPhone if itʼs lost\nor stolen\nItʼs easy to find your iPhone if it ever gets lost or stolen—as\nlong as you turn on Find My iPhone before that happens. First,\nmake sure youʼre signed in to your Apple Account, then go to\nSettings  > [your name] > Find My > Find My iPhone, and turn\non Find My iPhone.\nAfter you turn on Find My iPhone, you can use the Find My app\non another Apple device to see the location of your iPhone; you\ncan even play a sound on your lost iPhone to help you find it.\n(Make sure youʼre signed in to the same Apple Account on the\nother Apple device.) If you donʼt have another Apple device, go\nto www.icloud.com/find on any web browser and sign in to the\nsame Apple Account.\nRecover deleted photos or videos\nWhen you delete photos or videos from the Photos app, theyʼre\nautomatically saved in the Recently Deleted album for 30 days.\nIf you accidentally delete a photo or video, you can recover it\nand restore it to your Photos library.\nTo recover deleted items, open the Photos app , tap Recently\nDeleted (below Utilities), then tap View Album. Unlock the\nalbum using your iPhone passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID. Tap a\nphoto or video, tap Recover, then tap Recover Photo or Recover\nVideo.\nMaximize the life of your iPhone\nbattery\nThere are a few easy steps you can take to preserve the life of\nyour iPhone battery. First, make sure your iPhone is updated to\nthe latest version of iOS. To check if a software update is\navailable, go to Settings  > General > Software Update.\nNext, always connect to Wi-Fi when itʼs available; a Wi-Fi\nconnection uses less battery power than a cellular connection.\nLast, turn down your screen brightness: Open Control Center\nand drag . To automatically dim your screen based on the\nsurrounding light, go to Settings  > Accessibility > Display &\nText Size, then turn on Auto-Brightness.\nTo learn more about your iPhone battery health, go to Settings \n > Battery.\nIf you get a new phone number\nThe phone number associated with your Apple Account is often\nused to verify your identity and authenticate that your iPhone is\nreally yours—itʼs known as your trusted phone number. If you\nget a new phone number, make sure you update your trusted\nphone number so you donʼt lose access to your account if you\nforget your Apple Account password, or move to a new iPhone.\nTo update your trusted phone number, go to Settings  > [your\nname] > Sign-In & Security, then tap Edit next to Email & Phone\nNumbers. Tap Add Email or Phone Number, then tap Add a\nPhone Number. Enter your new phone number and follow the\nonscreen instructions to verify your new number.\nAll about eSIM\nAn eSIM is a digital version of the physical SIM card inside your\niPhone that connects to your cellular carrier. With eSIM, you\ndonʼt have to swap out your SIM card when you get a new\niPhone, and you can easily connect to new cellular carriers at\nhome or while traveling. If you purchased an iPhone 14 model or\nlater in the United States, your iPhone automatically connects\nto your cellular carrier using eSIM.\nIf you erase your iPhone, or restore it from a backup and\naccidentally delete your eSIM, your iPhone may lose its cellular\nconnection; to restore it, youʼll need to contact your cellular\nprovider.\nWant to learn more?\nKeep your Apple Account secure on iPhone\nLocate a device in Find My on iPhone\nDelete or hide photos and videos on iPhone\nCheck the iPhone battery health and usage\nSet up an eSIM\nNot all features are available for all iPhone models.Select version:\niOS 18\nPrevious\nUse iPhone for your daily routinesNext\nWhatʼs new in iOS 18 Search this guide\n\n Suppor t  iPhone User Guide  Exper t advice fr om Apple Suppor t\nCopyright © 2024 Apple Inc.

(Not all options are available\non all models or in all countries and regions. On iPhone 14 and later models purchased in the U.S., you can\nonly use eSIM.) Contact your carrier to get a SIM and set up cellular service.\nSupported iPhone models can digitally store an eSIM provided by your carrier. If your carrier supports\neither eSIM Carrier Activation or eSIM Quick Transfer, you can turn on your iPhone and follow the\ninstructions to activate your eSIM during setup.\nIf you already completed setup, you can do any of the following:\neSIM Carrier Activation: Some carriers can assign a new eSIM directly to your iPhone; contact your\ncarrier to initiate this process. When you receive the “Finish Setting Up Cellular” notification, tap it. Or\ngo to Settings  > Cellular, then tap Set Up Cellular or Add eSIM.\neSIM Quick Transfer: Some carriers support transferring a phone number from your previous iPhone to\nyour new iPhone without needing to contact them (requires iOS 16 or later on both devices).\nOn your new iPhone, go to Settings > Cellular, tap Set Up Cellular or Add eSIM, then tap Transfer From\nNearby iPhone or choose a phone number. On your previous iPhone, follow the instructions to confirm\nthe transfer.\nNote: After your phone number is transferred to your new iPhone, it stops working on your previous\niPhone.\nScan a QR Code provided by your carrier: Go to Settings > Cellular, tap Set Up Cellular or Add eSIM,\nthen tap Use QR Code. (You may need to tap Other Options first.) Position iPhone so the QR code\nappears in the frame, or enter the details manually. You may be asked to enter a confirmation code\nprovided by your carrier.\nTransfer from a different smartphone: If your previous phone isnʼt an Apple iPhone, contact your\ncarrier to transfer the phone number.\nActivate service through a participating carrierʼs app: Go to the App Store, download the carrierʼs app,\nthen use the app to activate cellular service.\nNote: If prompted, connect your iPhone to an available Wi-Fi or cellular network. eSIM setup requires an\ninternet connection.\nYou can get a nano-SIM card from a carrier or move it from your previous iPhone.\nNote: Physical SIM isnʼt compatible with iPhone 14 and later models purchased in the U.S.\n\u0000. Insert a paper clip or SIM eject tool into the small hole of the SIM tray, then push in toward iPhone to\neject the tray.\nNote: The shape and orientation of the SIM tray depend on the iPhone model and your country or\nregion.\n\u0000. Remove the tray from iPhone.\n\u0000. Place the SIM in the tray. The angled corner determines the correct orientation.\n\u0000. Insert the tray back into iPhone.\n\u0000. If you previously set up a PIN on the SIM, carefully enter the PIN when prompted.\nWARNING: Never try to guess a SIM PIN. An incorrect guess can permanently lock your SIM, and you\nwonʼt be able to make phone calls or use cellular data through your carrier until you get a new SIM. See\nthe Apple Support article Use a SIM PIN for your iPhone or iPad.\nIf your carrier supports it, you can convert a physical SIM to an eSIM on a supported iPhone model.\n\u0000. Go to Settings  > Cellular, tap Set Up Cellular or Add eSIM, then choose the phone number with a\nphysical SIM.\n\u0000. Tap Convert to eSIM, then follow the onscreen instructions.\nImportant: The availability of cellular capabilities depends on the wireless network, your iPhone model,\nand your location.\nConsider applicable data, voice, and roaming charges when managing your cellular plans, especially when\nyou travel with iPhone.

See the Apple Support article How to\nunlock your iPhone for use with a different carrier.\nYou can set up Dual SIM with the following:\nOne physical SIM and one eSIM; available on iPhone X\u0000, iPhone X\u0000, iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone 13,\niPhone SE (2nd generation), and iPhone 14 and later (purchased outside the U.S.)\nTwo eSIMs; iPhone 13, iPhone SE (3rd generation), and later\nNote: eSIM isnʼt available in certain countries or regions.\n\u0000. Go to Settings  > Cellular, then make sure you have at least two lines (below SIMs). To add a line, see\nSet up cellular service.\n\u0000. Turn on two lines—tap a line, then tap Turn On this Line.\nYou can also change settings such as Cellular Plan Label, Wi-Fi Calling (if available from your carrier),\nCalls on Other Devices, or SIM PIN. The label appears in Phone, Messages, and Contacts.\n\u0000. Choose the default line for cellular data—tap Cellular Data, then tap a line. To use either line depending\non coverage and availability, turn on Allow Cellular Data Switching.\nYou may incur roaming charges if Data Roaming is on and youʼre outside the country or region covered\nby the carrierʼs network.\n\u0000. Choose the default line for voice calls—tap Default Voice Line, then tap a line.\nWhen using Dual SIM, note the following:\nWi-Fi Calling must be turned on for a line to enable that line to receive calls while the other line is in\nuse for a call. If you receive a call on one line while the other is in use for a call, and no Wi-Fi\nconnection is available, iPhone uses the cellular data of the line that is in use for the call to receive the\nother lineʼs call. Charges may apply. The line that is in use for the call must be permitted for data use in\nyour Cellular Data settings (either as the default line, or as the non-default line with Allow Cellular Data\nSwitching turned on) to receive the other lineʼs call.\nIf you donʼt turn on Wi-Fi Calling for a line, any incoming phone calls on that line (including calls from\nemergency services) go directly to voicemail (if available from your carrier) when the other line is in\nuse; you wonʼt receive missed call notifications.\nIf you set up conditional call forwarding (if available from your carrier) from one line to another when a\nline is busy or not in service, the calls donʼt go to voicemail; contact your carrier for setup information.\nIf you make a phone call from another device, such as your Mac, by relaying it through your iPhone\nwith Dual SIM, the call is made using your default voice line.\nIf you start an SMS/MMS Messages conversation using one line, you canʼt switch the conversation to\nyour other line; you need to delete the conversation and start a new conversation using the other line.\nAlso, you may incur additional charges if you send SMS/MMS attachments on the line thatʼs not\nselected for cellular data.\nInstant Hotspot and Personal Hotspot use the line selected for cellular data.\nSee also\nConnect to a cellular network if Wi-Fi isnʼt available\nView or change cellular data settings on iPhoneSelect version:\niOS 18\nSet up Dual SIM\nPrevious\nSet up cellular serviceNext\nConnect to the internet Search this guide\n\n Suppor t  iPhone User Guide  Use Dual SIM on iPhone\nCopyright © 2024 Apple Inc.

For all other cellular connections, you canʼt use internet services while youʼre talking on\nthe phone unless your iPhone also has a Wi-Fi connection to the internet. Depending on your network\nconnection, you may not be able to receive calls while your iPhone transfers data over the cellular network\n—when downloading a webpage, for example.\nGSM networks: On an EDGE or GPRS connection, incoming calls may go directly to voicemail during\ndata transfers. For incoming calls that you answer, data transfers are paused.\nCDMA networks: On EV-DO connections, data transfers are paused when you answer incoming calls.\nOn 1xRTT connections, incoming calls may go directly to voicemail during data transfers. For incoming\ncalls that you answer, data transfers are paused.\nData transfer resumes when you end the call.\nIf Cellular Data is off, all data services—including email, web browsing, and push notifications—use Wi-Fi\nonly.

When youʼre traveling, you can turn off Data\nRoaming to avoid roaming charges.\nReduce cellular usage: Tap Data Mode, then choose Low Data Mode. This mode pauses automatic\nupdates and background tasks when iPhone isnʼt connected to Wi-Fi.\nDepending on your iPhone model, carrier, and region, the following options may be available:\nTurn Voice Roaming on or off: (CDMA) Turn Voice Roaming off to avoid charges from using other\ncarrierʼs networks. When your carrierʼs network isnʼt available, iPhone wonʼt have cellular (data or\nvoice) service.\nEnable or disable 4G/LTE: Using 4G or LTE loads internet data faster in some cases but may decrease\nbattery performance.

Yes NoiOS 18\nTable of Contents \nLock or hide an app on iPhone\nIf you want to show someone something on your iPhone but want peace of mind that they canʼt get into\ncertain apps, you can lock or hide the apps. Locking an app requires Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode\nto open it. Information inside a locked app wonʼt appear in other locations on your device—for example, in\nnotification previews, search, Siri suggestions, or your call history.\nWhen you lock or hide an app on your device, itʼs only locked or hidden on that device. The locked or\nhidden status of an app doesnʼt sync with iCloud.\nNote: Children under 13 in a Family Sharing group canʼt lock or hide apps. Anyone aged 13 to 17 in a Family\nSharing group can lock or hide an app, but a parent or guardian in the family group can see that the app\nwas downloaded and how much time itʼs used, and restrict access to it using Screen Time. (These ages\nvary by country or region.)\nLocking an app requires Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode to open the app.\nNote: Some of the apps that come with iPhone canʼt be locked—including Calculator, Camera, Clock,\nContacts, Find My, Maps, Shortcuts, and Settings.\n\u0000.

Write a different symbol to the left of each digit if you want a different\noperation.\n\u0000. Tap the equal sign to see what Math Notes understood in what you wrote. To correct mistakes, you can\nfix any of the following:\nUnrecognized math and unsolvable expressions: Tap any dotted red lines to see details about the\nerror.\nAmbiguous characters: Tap any dotted blue lines to clarify what you wrote.\nSee the Apple Support article How to handle errors in Math Notes to learn more.\nMath Notes uses the standard order of operations in horizontal expressions. For example, multiplication is\ncompleted before addition and subtraction. Add parentheses around expressions that you want calculated\nfirst. In vertically stacked math, Math Notes evaluates expressions from top to bottom.\nMath Notes automatically converts any units and currency used in expressions. You can also mix different\nsystems—for example, 42 meters + 143 feet. Available units and currency match the Convert mode of the\nbasic or scientific calculator.

Type or write the variable name in an expression or an equation to use it.\nNote: Math Notes reads entries from top left to bottom right. You must declare a variable (for example, x =\n5) before using it in an expression (such as x + 10 =). Writing an expression without first declaring a\nvariable produces an error. Variable names must contain characters only from the Latin alphabet.

    "text": "Helpful? Yes NoTable of Contents \nSet up security cameras in Home on iPhone\nYou can use the Home app to view video activity captured by your homeʼs cameras. With any HomeKit-\ncompatible camera, you can view video streams in the Home app, choose who can view those streams,\nand set up notifications when activity is detected.\nSee the Home accessories website for a list of compatible security cameras.\nIf you have one or more HomeKit Secure Video cameras, you can additionally take advantage of these\nfeatures:\nEncrypted video: Video captured by your cameras is privately analyzed and encrypted on your home\nhub device (Apple TV or HomePod) and securely uploaded to iCloud so that only you and those you\nshare it with can view it.\nRecord video: If you subscribe to iCloud+, you can view the last 10 days of activity from one to an\nunlimited number of cameras. The 50 GB iCloud+ plan supports a single camera, the 200 GB iCloud+\nplan supports up to five cameras, and the 2 TB, 6 TB, and 12 TB iCloud+ plans support an unlimited\nnumber of cameras.\nNote: Video content doesnʼt count against your iCloud storage limit.\nActivity Zones: Create zones that focus your camera on the most important areas within its view.\nFace recognition: Receive notifications when people youʼve tagged in the Photos app are within the\ncameraʼs view.\nSee Store encrypted security camera footage in iCloud with HomeKit Secure Video and Set up HomeKit\nSecure Video on all your devices in the iCloud User Guide.\nWhen you add a camera in the Home app, you can choose streaming options and assign the camera to a\nroom. With a HomeKit Secure Video camera, you can also choose recording options. By default, up to four\ncameras are marked as favorites and appear on the Home tab. To edit those settings later, tap the Camera\ntile, then tap  to see these options:\nRoom: A camera can be located in a room inside your home, or you can create a room for an outside\nlocation such as your front porch or back yard.\nNotifications: Tap Status and Notifications, then choose to receive notifications when the camera\ndetects activity, changes status, or goes offline.\nRecording options for HomeKit Secure Video cameras: You can create separate recording settings for\nwhen youʼre home and when youʼre away. For example, when youʼre home, you might choose to stop\nstreaming and recording from a camera inside your home, but continue to stream and record from an\noutdoor camera.\nNote: The Home app uses the location of devices belonging to members of the home to switch\nbetween Home and Away modes. For example, when you leave home with your iPhone, the camera\nswitches from the When Home settings to the When Away settings.\n\u0000. Go to the Home app  on your iPhone.\n\u0000. On the Home tab, tap , then tap Home Settings.\n\u0000. Tap Cameras & Doorbells.\n\u0000. Tap a camera, then turn on Activity Notifications.\nAll HomeKit-compatible cameras can send a notification when motion is detected. HomeKit Secure\nVideo cameras can additionally send notifications based on these factors:\nThe time of day\nWhen someone is or isnʼt home\nWhen a clip is recorded\nWhen any or a specific type of motion is detected\nWhen you choose a specific motion, you receive a notification when the camera detects people,\nanimals, or vehicles, or when a package is delivered. For a package to be detected, it must be\nwithin the cameraʼs view after delivery.\nChoosing a specific motion, rather than any motion, results in fewer clips (and fewer clip\nnotifications) and less video to review. For example, if you choose to detect people, your camera\ndoesnʼt capture the movement of leaves on a tree or a squirrel leaping from branch to branch.\nYou can create zones that focus your HomeKit Secure Video camera on the most important areas within its\nview—your front walkway but not the sidewalk behind it, for example. You can then be alerted when\nmotion is detected in these zones.\nNote: You can create Activity Zones only for cameras set up to record when a specific motion is detected.\nActivity Zones donʼt affect motion detection automations.\n\u0000. Go to the Home app  on your iPhone.\n\u0000. On the Home tab, tap the camera tile, then tap .\n\u0000. Tap Select Activity Zones, then tap the video to create a zone.\nTo have your camera detect motion only outside the zone you defined, tap Invert Zone.\n\u0000. Create any additional zones you want within the cameraʼs view—one for the driveway and another for\nthe mailbox, for example.\n\u0000. Tap Done.\nTo remove an activity zone, tap Select Activity Zones, tap inside a zone, then tap Clear.\n\u0000. Go to the Home app  on your iPhone.\n\u0000. On the Home tab, tap the camera tile.\nLive video should play automatically.\n\u0000. If youʼve chosen to record video with your HomeKit Secure Video camera, swipe through the timeline\nat the bottom of the screen to browse recorded clips.\n\u0000. Tap a clip to play it.\n\u0000. Tap Live to switch back to live video.\nWhen you set up the camera to detect specific motion, the timeline displays unique symbols for people,\nanimals, vehicles, and packages.\nNote: If there are more cameras in your home than Home Hubs that can analyze the camerasʼ video, video\ncaptured from some of the cameras may not be analyzed. Clips are still recorded, but theyʼll show\n, which indicates that the video wasnʼt analyzed for specific motion.\nYou can also view live and recorded video in the Home app on your Mac with macOS 10.15.1 or later.\nTo allow other people to view video from your cameras, follow these steps:\n\u0000. Go to the Home app  on your iPhone.\n\u0000. On the Home tab, tap , then tap Home Settings.\n\u0000. Below the People heading, tap a person.\n\u0000.

Yes NoTable of Contents \nCollaborate on projects with Messages on\niPhone\nIn the Messages app , you can send a text message to invite people to collaborate on a project, and\neveryone in the conversation is added to the document, spreadsheet, or other shared file.\nNote: To start collaborating on a project with Messages, you and your recipients must be using iMessage\nwith iOS 16, iPadOS 16, macOS 13, watchOS 9, visionOS 1, or later, and you must first save the content\nsomewhere it can be accessed by others, such as iCloud Drive. For iPhone apps, you may need to turn on\niCloud to use their collaboration features: go to Settings  > [your name] > iCloud, then tap See All next\nto Saved to iCloud.\nYou can invite people to collaborate on a project from another app, and then discuss your content in\nMessages. Share files from apps like Notes, Freeform, Reminders, Safari, Keynote, Numbers, Pages, and\nmore, as long as you first turn on their collaboration features in iCloud settings and save the content\nsomewhere it can be accessed by others, such as iCloud Drive.\nThe process for inviting someone to collaborate depends on the app. Hereʼs one way you might start a\ncollaboration in a supported app:\n\u0000. Select the file you want to share, then tap , or tap Collaborate.\n\u0000. Make sure Collaborate (rather than Send Copy) is selected, then tap the group or individual you want\nto collaborate with. If you donʼt see the group or person listed, tap .\nThe suggested icons may correspond with groups or individuals with active FaceTime calls or recent\nMessages conversations.\n\u0000. A Messages conversation opens with the invitation ready to send. Add a note (optional), then tap .\nAfter you invite participants in Messages, you can work on the project in the other app and return to the\nMessages conversation by tapping the Collaborate button in that app.\nWhen someone edits the file, you see updates at the top of the Messages thread. To return to the shared\nproject and see changes, tap an update.\nNote: Your participants may need to accept your invitation or join the shared item before they can interact\nwith it or see any updates.\nAfter you share your project, you see activity updates at the top of the Messages conversation whenever\nsomeone makes an edit.\n\u0000. Go to the Messages app  on your iPhone.\n\u0000. Go to the conversation that contains the invitation to the project youʼve started collaborating on, then\ndo any of the following to return to the project:\nTap the file in your conversation to open it.\nIf you see an update at the top of the conversation, tap Show.\nTap the name of your participant or group at the top of the screen, scroll to Collaboration, then tap\nthe shared project.\nWhen you make any changes or edits to the project, your participants get updates in the conversation.\nNote: If you add a new person to a group conversation, you have to grant them access to the projects\nyouʼre collaborating on. If theyʼve been added to the group conversation recently, you can tap a\nnotification at the top of screen to add them. Or invite them to collaborate.\nThe group of people in the Messages collaboration and the group collaborating on the file may not match.\nFor example, you may invite people to collaborate on the file outside of Messages. Or you may have two\ndifferent groups in Messages, each with its own collaboration conversation.\nIf you share a project with two or more people in a Messages conversation, you can add or remove\nparticipants.\n\u0000. Go to the Messages app  on your iPhone.\n\u0000. Go to the conversation you want to manage, then tap the group icon at the top of the conversation to\nopen details about the groupʼs conversation.\n\u0000. Tap the button showing the participants in the conversation, then do any of the following:\nAdd new participants: Scroll to the bottom of the list, tap Add Contact , then add contacts.\nIf you started collaborating with just one other person, you must start a new conversation to add\npeople to the collaboration.\nNote: You must add new participants to any files that were shared in the conversation before they\njoined. As you add participants, a notification appears at the top of the conversation. Tap Show in\nthe notification to review the previously shared files you can add new participants to.\nRemove participants from the conversation: Swipe left on the name of the person you want to\nremove, then tap Remove.\nImportant: The apps where the collaboration happens usually control access to the project. Check\nparticipant access in the app itself to remove viewing or editing privileges completely.\nWhen you add someone to a document youʼve shared with others earlier, you have the option of adding\nthem to an existing conversation or keeping the conversations separate. People added to conversations\narenʼt able to read messages sent before they joined the conversation.\nThe apps where the collaboration happens usually control access to the project. For example, if youʼre\ncollaborating on a document in the Pages app, the Pages settings take precedence over the Messages\nsettings. You can, however, unsend or delete the invitation from the conversation just as you would any\nother message.\nImportant: When you delete an invitation from a thread, that conversation is no longer associated with the\ncollaboration, but it doesnʼt remove participants from the file. Check participant access in the app to\nremove viewing or editing privileges completely.\nSee also\nShare content in Messages on iPhone\nHave a group conversation in Messages on iPhoneSelect version:\niOS 18\nInvite people to collaborate\nCollaborate on a project in Messages\nManage the collaboration and group\nStop collaborating on a project in Messages\nPrevious\nShare screensNext\nUse iMessage apps\n\n Suppor t  iPhone User Guide  Collaborat e on pr ojects with Mes sages on iPhone\nCopyright © 2024 Apple Inc.

The entire\nApple Music catalog is encoded using ALAC in resolutions ranging from 16-bit/44.1 kHz (CD Quality) up to\n24-bit/192 kHz.\nStreaming lossless audio over a cellular or Wi-Fi network consumes significantly more data. And\ndownloading lossless audio uses significantly more space on your device. Higher resolutions use more\ndata than lower ones.\nAirPods, AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and Beats wireless headphones use Apple AAC Bluetooth Codec to\nensure excellent audio quality. However, Bluetooth connections arenʼt lossless.\nTo get a lossless version of music that you already downloaded from Apple Music, just delete the\nmusic and redownload it from the Apple Music catalog.\nTo play songs at sample rates higher than 48 kHz on iPhone, you need an external digital-to-analog\nconverter.\nNote: Apple Music and lossless arenʼt available in all countries or regions.

    "text": "Helpful? Yes NoTable of Contents \nIntroducing Apple Intelligence on iPhone\nApple Intelligence is the personal intelligence system built into iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia\n15.1. It combines the power of generative models with an understanding of your personal context to deliver\nintelligence thatʼs useful and relevant. Apple Intelligence is designed to understand and create language\nand images; prioritize and summarize notifications, mail, and messages; and draw from what it knows\nabout you and the device you use to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. And it does all this while\nprotecting your privacy—ensuring that your data is never stored and never made accessible to anyone.\nSupported devices: Apple Intelligence is available on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, all iPhone 16\nmodels, and iPad and Mac models with M1 and later. iPhone devices need 4GB of storage*.\nAvailability: Apple Intelligence will initially be available in most regions around the world, with Siri and\ndevice language set to U.S. English. For more information see Apple Intelligence requirements.\nHow to get started: To request activation of Apple Intelligence on your iPhone or iPad, go to Settings\n, tap Apple Intelligence & Siri, then tap Join the Apple Intelligence Waitlist. To request activation on\nyour Mac, choose Apple menu  > System Settings, click Apple Intelligence & Siri, then click Join the\nApple Intelligence Waitlist. Youʼll be notified as soon as Apple Intelligence is ready for your device.\nNote: Apple Intelligence is currently in beta. Apple Intelligence uses generative models, and outputs may\nbe inaccurate, unexpected, or offensive. Check important information for accuracy.\nFind the right words with Writing\nTools\nWriting Tools can summarize selected text with a tap, proofread\nyour work, and create different versions of the same text to help\nyou find the right wording and tone.\nWriting Tools are available virtually everywhere you write,\nincluding Mail, Notes, Safari, and more. As youʼre writing, just\nselect the text you want to refine, then tap Writing Tools.\nDiscover a more capable and\nconversational Siri\nApple Intelligence uses systemwide intelligence to expand and\nenhance Siri capabilities. With richer language understanding,\nSiri is becoming more natural, more contextually relevant, and\nmore personal, with the ability to simplify and accelerate\neveryday tasks. Siri also knows more about your deviceʼs\nfeatures and settings. To learn how to do things with your\niPhone, just ask Siri—“How do I use AirDrop?” or “How do I\nschedule a message to send later?”\nIntelligent features in Mail, Messages, and Photos\nIn the Mail app, Priority Messages shows your most urgent emails at the top of your inbox. You can also\nsee summaries for an email without needing to open it. Smart Reply in Mail and Messages identifies\nquestions and suggests answers to make it faster to draft a response.\nIn Photos, you can search for specific images by describing what you want to find—“Maya skateboarding\nin a tie-dye shirt,” for example. You can also search for specific moments in a video and go right to the\nrelevant segment.\nYou can also use the Clean Up photo-editing tool in Photos to identify and remove distracting background\nobjects without altering the subject. Open a photo in the Photos app, tap , tap Clean Up, then follow the\nonscreen instructions.\nAnd more…\nMore is still to come. Image Playground will let you create original images—in Messages, Notes (using the\nnew Image Wand), and more—based on a description or suggested concept. Youʼll be able to create\noriginal Genmoji in supported apps with an emoji keyboard. Just tap , type a description of the image\nyou want—“Golden Retriever catching the best wave ever,” for example—then tap Create New Emoji.\nYouʼll also be able to search across information on your device—including what friends have sent to you—\nso Siri can answer a question like “What are the book recommendations Jane sent me?” And you can\nenable integration with ChatGPT, so you can tap into its expertise from Siri or Writing Tools.\nIntelligence that protects your privacy\nApple Intelligence relies on understanding deep personal context while also protecting user privacy. Itʼs\nintegrated into the core of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac through on-device processing. So your personal\ninformation is used to process requests without collecting or storing it. To run more complex requests that\nrequire more processing power, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of Apple devices\ninto the cloud. Apple Intelligence draws on larger, server-based models powered by Apple silicon, which\nhelps Apple ensure your data is never stored and never made accessible to anyone.\nTo deactivate Apple Intelligence during the beta period, on iPhone or iPad, go to Settings , tap Apple\nIntelligence & Siri, then tap the button next to Apple Intelligence. On a Mac, choose Apple menu  >\nSystem Settings, click Apple Intelligence & Siri, then click the button next to Apple Intelligence.\nFor more information about whatʼs possible with Apple Intelligence, see the Apple Intelligence website.\n*Storage requirements for on-device Apple Intelligence models will increase as more features roll out.Select version:\niOS 18\nPrevious\nChange Siri settingsNext\nContact emergency services\n\n Suppor t  iPhone User Guide  Introducing Apple Int elligence on iPhone\nCopyright © 2024 Apple Inc.

For example, you can perform a two-\nfinger tap using two fingers on one hand, one finger on each hand, or your thumbs. Instead of selecting an\nitem and double-tapping, you can use a split-tap gesture—touch and hold an item with one finger, then\ntap the screen with another finger.\nTo explore the screen, drag your finger over it. VoiceOver speaks the name of each item you touch.\nYou can also use VoiceOver gestures to explore the screen in order, from top to bottom and left to right.\nAction Gesture\nSelect and speak an item Tap or touch the item\nSelect the next item Swipe right\nSelect the previous item Swipe left\nMove into a group of items Two-finger swipe right\nMove out of a group of items Two-finger swipe left\nSelect the first item on the screen Four-finger tap near the top of the screen\nSelect the last item on the screen Four-finger tap near the bottom of the screen\nSpeak the entire screen from the top Two-finger swipe up\nSpeak the entire screen from the selected item Two-finger swipe down\nPause or continue speaking Two-finger tap\nSpeak additional information, such as the position\nwithin a list or whether text is selectedThree-finger tap\nFor more information about navigation styles, see Use flat or grouped navigation.\nUse VoiceOver gestures to move to another page.\nAction Gesture\nScroll up one page Three-finger swipe down\nScroll down one page Three-finger swipe up\nScroll left one page Three-finger swipe right\nScroll right one page Three-finger swipe left\nUse VoiceOver gestures to perform actions on an item.\nAction Gesture\nSelect an item Tap\nActivate the selected item Double tap\nDouble-tap the selected item Triple tap\nDrag a slider Tap the slider to select it, then swipe up or down with one\nfinger; or double-tap and hold the slider until you hear\nthree rising tones, then drag the slider\nStart or stop the current action (for example, play or\npause music or a video, take a photo in Camera, start\nor stop a recording, start or stop the stopwatch)Two-finger double tap\nDismiss an alert or return to the previous screen Two-finger scrub (move two fingers back and forth three\ntimes quickly, making a “z”)\nEdit an itemʼs label to make it easier to find Two-finger double tap and hold\nTip: As an alternative to selecting an item and double-tapping to activate it, touch and hold an item\nwith one finger, then tap the screen with another.\nUse these gestures to control VoiceOver.\nAction Gesture\nMute or unmute VoiceOver Three-finger double tap.\nIf both VoiceOver and Zoom are turned on, use the three-\nfinger triple-tap gesture.\nTurn the screen curtain on or off\n(When the screen curtain is on, the screen contents are\nactive even though the display is black and appears to\nbe turned off.)Three-finger triple tap.\nIf both VoiceOver and Zoom are turned on, use the three-\nfinger quadruple-tap gesture.\nUse a standard gesture Double-tap and hold your finger on the screen until you\nhear three rising tones, then make the gesture.

If you just want to enter text using Dictation, without controlling your iPhone with your voice, see\nDictate text. Voice Control isnʼt available in all languages. See the iOS and iPadOS Feature Availability\nwebpage.\nBefore you turn on Voice Control for the first time, make sure iPhone is connected to the internet over a\nWi-Fi network. After iPhone completes a one-time file download from Apple, you donʼt need an internet\nconnection to use Voice Control.\n\u0000. Go to Settings  > Accessibility > Voice Control.\n\u0000. Tap Set Up Voice Control, then tap Continue to start the file download.\nWhen the download is complete,  appears in the status bar to indicate that Voice Control is turned\non.\n\u0000. Set options such as the following:\nLanguage: Set the language and download languages for offline use.\nCustomize Commands: View the available commands and create new commands.\nVocabulary: Teach Voice Control to recognize new words and phrases. You can enter a word or\nphrase and teach Voice Control how you pronounce it, or import a vocabulary list.\nNote: Not all Voice Control languages support a custom vocabulary.\nShow Confirmation: When Voice Control recognizes a command, a visual confirmation appears at\nthe top of the screen.\nPlay Sound: When Voice Control recognizes a command, an audible sound is played.\nShow Hints: See command suggestions and hints.\nOverlay: Display numbers, names, or a grid over screen elements.\nAttention Aware: On an iPhone with Face ID, Voice Control wakes up when you look at your iPhone\nand goes to sleep when you look away.\nAfter you set up Voice Control, you can turn it on or off quickly by doing any of the following:\nUse Control Center if youʼve added Voice Control there.\nUse Accessibility Shortcut if youʼve set it up to turn on Voice Control.\nSiri: Say something like: “Turn on Voice Control” or “Turn off Voice Control.” Learn how to use Siri.\nTo use Voice Control on your iPhone, just say a command.\nVoice Control: Say, for example, “Open Control Center,” “Go home,” “Tap item name,” or “Turn up\nvolume.”\nTip: Use the interactive Voice Control Tutorial to get familiar with Voice Control and practice essential\ncommands. Go to Settings  > Accessibility > Voice Control, then tap Open Voice Control Tutorial.\nPause Voice Control when you donʼt want words you say to be interpreted as commands or dictation.\nResume Voice Control when youʼre ready for it to listen for commands and dictation again.\nVoice Control: Say “Stop listening” or “Start listening.”\nDisplay a list of the available commands, which vary depending on the app youʼre working in and what\nyouʼre doing. For example, you see text formatting commands while writing a document.\nVoice Control: Say “Show commands.”\nTo browse the full list of supported commands and see examples of how to use them, go to Settings  >\nAccessibility > Voice Control > Commands.\nWhen youʼre not sure what to call something, you can display a name or number next to each item on the\nscreen. You can then use the itemʼs name or number to interact with it.\nVoice Control: Say “Show names” or “Show numbers.”\nTo interact with an item, say its name or number, or say a command—such as “Long press”—followed by\nthe itemʼs name or number. The item names or numbers disappear after you say the command.\nYou can make it easier to interact with a precise area of the screen by superimposing a grid.\nVoice Control: Say “Show grid.”\nInteract with a location on the grid: If a number is at the location you want to interact with, say any\ncommand—such as “Tap”—followed by the grid number. The grid disappears after you say the\ncommand.\nDrill down on an area of the grid: If you need to further refine the location, say a grid number to show a\nmore detailed grid in that area.\nSay “Hide names,” “Hide numbers,” or “Hide grid” to turn the overlay off.\nWhen working in a text input area, you can dictate word by word (with Dictation mode) or character by\ncharacter (with Spelling mode). To avoid mistakenly entering a Voice Control command as text, have Voice\nControl respond only to commands (with Command mode).\nWhen youʼre in a text input area and label onscreen items with numbers, numbers are shown next to each\nline of text. Select a line or another section of the text to display a number for each word in the selection;\nselect a single word to show a number for each character in the word. To interact with a text item (such as\na line or a word), say a command followed by the itemʼs name or number. For example, you can say\n“Delete [item number]” or “Uppercase [item number].”\nCommand Description\nVoice Control: Say “Dictation mode.” Dictate word by word.\nAny words you say that arenʼt Voice Control commands\nare entered as text. Dictation mode is on by default.\nIn some Voice Control languages, if several words\nphonetically match what you say, they appear onscreen.\nTap to choose the one you want.\nVoice Control: Say “Spelling mode.” Dictate character by character.\nSpelling mode is helpful when you need to enter a\npassword, a web address, or another sequence of\ncharacters that wouldnʼt be recognized as a word in\nDictation mode.\nWhen Spelling mode is on,  appears in the text input\narea.\nTo increase accuracy when entering letters, you can use\nthe letterʼs phonetic alphabet code word (for example,\nsay “Alfa Bravo Charlie” to enter “abc”).\nNote: Spelling mode isnʼt available in all Voice Control\nlanguages.\nVoice Control: Say “Command mode.” Voice Control responds only to commands.\nWords and characters that arenʼt commands are ignored\nand arenʼt entered as text.

It enables you to interact with\niPhone by activating a switch, such as pressing an external adaptive button, performing a head movement,\nor making a voiced or voiceless sound. Using one or more switches, you can navigate a cursor around the\niPhone screen, then open the Scanner menu to choose an available action such as tap, zoom in, zoom out,\nand more.\nA switch can be an external hardware device or a feature on your iPhone.\nSwitches on iPhone donʼt require any additional hardware. For example:\nScreen: Use a tap or long press anywhere on the iPhone screen. You can set up tap and long press as\ntwo different switches with separate actions.\nCamera: While in view of the front-facing iPhone camera, move your head to the left or right, or pinch\nyour left or right index finger and thumb. You can set up each gesture as a different switch with a\nseparate action.\nBack Tap: Double-tap or triple-tap the back of iPhone. You can set up double tap and triple tap as two\ndifferent switches with separate actions.\nSound: Make simple voiced sounds (such as “Oo”) or voiceless sounds (such as a pop). You can set up\neach sound as a different switch with a separate action.\nAirPods: Nod or shake your head while wearing supported AirPods that are paired with your iPhone.\nYou can set up nod and shake as two different switches with separate actions.\nGaming: Turn any switch into a virtual game controller to play your favorite games on iPhone.\nExternal switches connect to iPhone through Bluetooth® or the Lightning or USB-C connector. For\nexample:\nAdaptive accessory\nJoystick\nGame controller\nMFi switch or switch interface\nIn Switch Control, each switch performs a specific action—for example, Move To Next Item moves the\ncursor to the next item on the screen. The switchʼs action is performed when you activate the switch—\nsuch as by pressing the adaptive button, moving your head, or making a sound.\nYou can use just one switch, or you can use multiple switches for different actions, depending on how you\nlike to work. For example, you can activate your Move to Next Item switch to move the cursor from one\nitem to the next. When the cursor highlights the item you want, you can activate your Select Item switch.\nSee also\nSet up and turn on Switch Control on iPhone\nAccessibility features for mobility on iPhoneSelect version:\niOS 18\nWhat is a switch?\nHow does Switch Control work?\nPrevious\nControl iPhone with the movement of your eyesNext\nSet up and turn on Switch Control\n\n Suppor t  iPhone User Guide  Intro to Swit ch Contr ol on iPhone\nCopyright © 2024 Apple Inc.

    "text": "Helpful? Yes NoTable of Contents \nSet up and turn on Switch Control on iPhone\nTo set up Switch Control, you need to connect and add one or more switches, then assign an action to\neach switch. You can choose a scanning style and fine-tune other settings to suit your needs. After you\nturn on Switch Control, you may need to change the assigned actions or readjust the settings. If you have\ndifficulty performing these steps, you can get personalized help at your nearest Apple Store.\nIf you want to use an adaptive accessory, joystick, game controller, or MFi device for Switch Control, you\nneed to first connect it to iPhone by following the manufacturerʼs instructions. If the switch connects using\nBluetooth®, you need to pair it with iPhone.\n\u0000. Turn on the switch.\n\u0000. Go to Settings  > Bluetooth, turn on Bluetooth, tap the name of the switch, then follow the onscreen\ninstructions.\nYou can use only one switch, or you can use multiple switches to accommodate different actions. Each\nswitch performs an assigned action, such as selecting an item or moving the cursor to the next item.\n\u0000. Go to Settings  > Accessibility > Switch Control > Switches.\n\u0000. Tap Add New Switch, then choose External, Screen, Camera, Back Tap, or Sound.\nIf youʼre trying to add an external switch but it isnʼt shown in the list, make sure itʼs connected to your\niPhone as described above in Step 1: Connect an external switch (optional).\n\u0000. Assign an action to the switch.\nThe action for the switch depends on the number of switches you have and the scanning style you\nchoose in Step 3: Choose a scanning style, below. If you donʼt know which action to assign, choose\nSelect Item, which is compatible with Auto Scanning (the default scanning style). You can return to this\nsetting later to change the assigned action.\nTip: Turn your iPhone into a game controller that uses gestures youʼve already set up, like the same\nswitch (or alternative input method) that you navigate and control your iPhone with. Or you may decide\nto reuse your Back Tap gestures instead.\nBy default, the cursor automatically moves from one item to the next after a specified duration. If you\nprefer to move the cursor manually, you can choose a different scanning style.\nGo to Settings  > Accessibility > Switch Control > Scanning Style, then choose one of the following:\nAuto Scanning: The cursor automatically moves to the next item after a specified duration. This is the\ndefault scanning style.\nIf you use Auto Scanning with just one switch, make sure the Select Item action is assigned to the\nswitch.\nManual Scanning: When you activate your Move to Next Item switch, the cursor moves to the next\nitem.\nManual Scanning requires at least two switches. Make sure the Move to Next Item action is assigned to\none switch, and the Select Item action is assigned to another switch.\nSingle Switch Step Scanning: When you activate the Move to Next Item switch, the cursor moves to the\nnext item; if no action is taken within a specified duration, the current item is automatically selected.\nThis scanning style requires only one switch. Make sure the Move to Next Item action is assigned to\nthe switch.\nYou can adjust the behavior of Switch Control in a variety of ways, to suit your specific needs and style.\nFor example, you can change the scanning speed or have iPhone speak the highlighted items.\nGo to Settings  > Accessibility > Switch Control, then adjust any of the following:\nAuto Scanning Time: Adjust the item scanning speed.\nPause on First Item: Set scanning to pause on the first item in a group.\nLoops: Choose how many times to cycle through the screen before hiding Switch Control.\nMove Repeat: Set the delay before moving to the previous or next item while a switch is pressed.\nLong Press: Set whether a different action occurs when you press and hold a switch, and how long to\nwait before performing that action.\nTap Behavior: Choose a tap behavior and set the interval for performing a second switch action to\nshow the Scanner menu.\nFocused Item After Tap: Choose whether Switch Control resumes scanning at an item you tap or from\nthe beginning.\nHold Duration: Specify how long you need to press and hold a switch before itʼs accepted as a switch\naction.\nIgnore Repeat: Ignore accidental repeated switch triggers.\nSound Effects: Turn on sound effects.\nSpeech: Speak items as theyʼre scanned.\nMenu Items: Choose the actions shown in the Scanner menu and the order in which they appear.\nGroup Items: Group items for faster navigation.\nLarge Cursor: Make the highlight more prominent.\nCursor Color: Choose a different highlight color.\nImportant: When Switch Control is turned on, you canʼt use the standard gestures on the touchscreen to\nexit Switch Control.\nGo to Settings  > Accessibility > Switch Control, then turn on Switch Control.\nTip: You can add Switch Control to Accessibility Shortcut, then quickly turn it on or off by triple-\nclicking the side button (on an iPhone with Face ID) or the Home button (on other iPhone models).\nSee also\nIntro to Switch Control on iPhone\nUse Switch Control on iPhone to select items, perform actions, and more\nControl several devices with one switch on iPhone\nAccessibility features for mobility on iPhoneSelect version:\niOS 18\nStep 1: Connect an external switch (optional)\nStep 2: Add switches and assign actions\nStep 3: Choose a scanning style\nStep 4: Fine-tune Switch Control settings\nStep 5: Turn on Switch Control\nPrevious\nIntro to Switch ControlNext\nSelect items, perform actions, and more\n\n Suppor t  iPhone User Guide  Set up and tur n on Swit ch Contr ol on iPhone\nCopyright © 2024 Apple Inc.

    "text": "Helpful? Yes NoTable of Contents \nImportant handling information for iPhone\nCleaning.  Clean iPhone immediately if it comes in contact with anything that may cause stains, or other\ndamage—for example, dirt or sand, ink, makeup, soap, detergent, acids or acidic foods, or lotions. To\nclean:\nDisconnect all cables, then do one of the following to turn off iPhone:\nOn an iPhone with Face ID: Simultaneously press and hold the side button and either volume button\nuntil the sliders appear, then drag the top slider.\nOn an iPhone with a Home button: Press and hold the side button, then drag the slider.\nAll models: Go to Settings  > General > Shut Down, then drag the slider.\nUse a soft, slightly damp, lint-free cloth—for example, a lens cloth.\nAvoid getting moisture in openings.\nDonʼt use cleaning products or compressed air.\niPhone has a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic (oil-repellant) coating. This coating wears over time with\nnormal usage. Cleaning products and abrasive materials will further diminish the coating and may scratch\niPhone.\nExposure to liquid and dust.  If liquid splashes on iPhone or dust gets on it, wipe it off with a soft, lint-free\ncloth (for example, a lens cloth) and ensure that your iPhone is dry and free of dust before opening the\nSIM tray. Minimize exposing iPhone to soap, detergent, acids or acidic foods, and any liquids—for\nexample, salt water, soapy water, pool water, perfume, insect repellent, lotion, sunscreen, oil, adhesive\nremover, hair dye, and solvents. If iPhone comes into contact with any of these substances, follow the\ninstructions above in the Cleaning section.\nSupported models are splash, water, and dust resistant and were tested under controlled laboratory\nconditions with a rating of either IP68 or IP67 under IEC standard 60529. Splash, water, and dust\nresistance are not permanent conditions and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear. Liquid\ndamage not covered under warranty. See the Apple Support article About splash, water, and dust\nresistance of iPhone 7 and later. To prevent liquid damage on iPhone, avoid the following:\nSwimming or bathing with iPhone\nExposing iPhone to pressurized water or high velocity water, such as when showering, water skiing,\nwake boarding, surfing, jet skiing, and so on\nUsing iPhone in a sauna or steam room\nIntentionally submerging iPhone in water\nOperating iPhone outside the suggested temperature ranges or in extremely humid conditions\nDropping iPhone or subjecting it to other impacts\nDisassembling iPhone, including removing screws\nIf your iPhone has been exposed to liquid, unplug all cables and do not charge your device until itʼs\ncompletely dry. Using accessories or charging when wet may damage your iPhone. Allow at least 5 hours\nbefore charging or connecting a Lightning or USB-C accessory.\nTo dry iPhone, tap it gently against your hand with the Lightning or USB-C connector facing down to\nremove excess liquid. Leave the device in a dry area with sufficient airflow. Placing the device in front of a\nfan blowing cool air directly into the Lightning or USB-C connector may help the drying process.\nDo not dry your iPhone using an external heat source or insert a foreign object into the Lightning or USB-C\nconnector such as a cotton swab or a paper towel.\nUsing connectors, ports, and buttons.  Never force a connector into a port or apply excessive pressure\nto a button, because this may cause damage that is not covered under the warranty. If the connector and\nport donʼt join with reasonable ease, they probably donʼt match. Check for obstructions and make sure\nthat the connector matches the port and that you have positioned the connector correctly in relation to\nthe port.\nUSB-C or USB-C to Lightning Cables. Discoloration of the Lightning or USB-C connector after regular\nuse is normal. Dirt, debris, and exposure to moisture may cause discoloration. If your Lightning or USB-C\ncable or connector becomes warm during use or iPhone wonʼt charge or sync, disconnect it from your\ncomputer or power adapter and clean the Lightning or USB-C connector with a soft, dry, lint-free cloth. Do\nnot use liquids or cleaning products when cleaning the Lightning or USB-C connector.\nCertain usage patterns can contribute to the fraying or breaking of cables. The included cable, like any\nother metal wire or cable, is subject to becoming weak or brittle if repeatedly bent in the same spot. Aim\nfor gentle curves instead of angles in the cable. Regularly inspect the cable and connector for any kinks,\nbreaks, bends, or other damage. Should you find any such damage, discontinue use of the cable.\nOperating temperature.  iPhone is designed to work in ambient temperatures between 32° and 95° F (0°\nand 35° C) and stored in temperatures between -4° and 113° F (-20° and 45° C). iPhone can be damaged\nand battery life shortened if stored or operated outside of these temperature ranges. Avoid exposing\niPhone to dramatic changes in temperature or humidity. When youʼre using iPhone or charging the battery,\nit is normal for iPhone to get warm.\nIf the interior temperature of iPhone exceeds normal operating temperatures (for example, in a hot car or\nin direct sunlight for extended periods of time), you may experience the following as it attempts to regulate\nits temperature:\niPhone stops charging.\nThe screen dims.\nA temperature warning screen appears.\nSome apps may close.\nImportant: You may not be able to use iPhone while the temperature warning screen is displayed. If\niPhone canʼt regulate its internal temperature, it goes into deep sleep mode until it cools. Move iPhone to a\ncooler location out of direct sunlight and wait a few minutes before trying to use iPhone again.\nSee the Apple Support article Keeping iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch within acceptable operating\ntemperatures.Select version:\niOS 18\nPrevious\nImportant safety informationNext\nFind more resources for software and service\n\n Suppor t  iPhone User Guide  Impor tant handling inf ormation f or iPhone\nCopyright © 2024 Apple Inc.

Built-in security\nfeatures help protect against malware and viruses and secure user access to personal information and\ncorporate data. Unauthorized modifications to iOS (also known as “jailbreaking”) bypass security features\nand can cause numerous issues such as security vulnerabilities, instability, and shortened battery life to\nthe hacked iPhone.\nSecurity vulnerabilities. Jailbreaking your device eliminates security layers designed to protect your\npersonal information and your iOS device. With this security removed from your iPhone, hackers may\nsteal your personal information, damage your device, attack your network, or introduce malware,\nspyware, or viruses.\nInstability. Unauthorized modifications can cause frequent and unexpected crashes of the device,\ncrashes and freezes of built-in apps and third-party apps, and loss of data.\nShortened battery life. Hacked software can cause an accelerated battery drain that shortens the\noperation of iPhone on a single battery charge.\nUnreliable voice and data. Unauthorized modifications can cause dropped calls, slow or unreliable\ndata connections, and delayed or inaccurate location data.\nDisruption of services. Services such as iCloud, iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Pay, Visual Voicemail,\nWeather, and Stocks, may be disrupted or no longer work on the device. Additionally, third-party apps\nthat use the Apple Push Notification Service may experience difficulty receiving notifications or may\nreceive notifications intended for a different device. Other push-based services, such as iCloud and\nExchange, may experience problems syncing data with their respective servers.\nInability to apply future software updates. Some unauthorized modifications may cause damage to\niOS that is not repairable. This can result in the hacked iPhone becoming permanently inoperable when\na future Apple-supplied iOS update is installed.\nApple strongly cautions against installing any software that modifies iOS. It is also important to note that\nunauthorized modification of iOS is a violation of the iOS and iPadOS Software License Agreement and\nbecause of this, Apple may deny service for an iPhone that has any unauthorized software installed.\nInformation about products not manufactured by Apple, or independent websites not controlled or tested by Apple, is provided without recommendation or\nendorsement.
